            <p class="intro">The USS Enterprise (CV-6), nicknamed "The Big E," was the seventh U.S. Navy vessel to bear the name. It was a Yorktown-class aircraft carrier 
                and one of the most decorated ships of World War II. Commissioned in 1938, she was relocated to the pacific. When the Japanese attacked pearl
                harbor on December 1941, she served the war, being able to sink her first Japanese submarine HIJMS I-70. USS Enterprise played a pivotal role
                 in many significant battles such as the Battle of Midway and the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle in history.</p>

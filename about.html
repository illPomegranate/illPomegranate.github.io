                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>The idea for this website was born out of a school project and a passion for naval history. I wanted to create a platform where we could share my knowledge about some of the most famous ships in history. I do want to continuously expand the content and features as I learn more about web development. I want to continue this project even as a personal hobby.</p>
